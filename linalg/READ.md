**gemm.cpp** implements a general matrix multiplication (GEMM) function for computing the dot product of matrices A and B. The gemm_T function variant handles cases where matrix B is transposed before multiplication. Additionally, a transpose function is included. Although these functions are designed for 2D matrices, the values are stored in a flat 1D array, following conventions similar to those used in BLAS/LAPACK. I also used c++20 concepts to constrain the template arguments, which felt like an appropriate use caseâ€”similar to C++11 static_asserts. While actual linear algebra implementations could benefit from manual optimizations, the O3 optimization level automatically leverages SIMD registers, providing more than sufficient performance for typical use cases.

**cholesky_decomp.cpp** implements Cholesky Decomposition, a method for decomposing a positive definite matrix in a product of a lower triangular matrix and its transpose A = LLT, where A is a symmetric, positive definite matrix, L is a lower triangular matrix, and LT is L transposed. It is faster and more efficient for certain matrix types than general-purpose decompositions, and numerically stable.
